#summary Alfresco activity stats.

= 1 Introduction=
<p>
The module *Activity Stats* is a simple activity reporting tool for Alfresco Share.
</p>
<p>
It gives to the Alfresco administrator a easy way to monitor the user connections and activities. An administrator can easily send a message to all currently connected users, i.e.to warn them before a maintenance operation.
</p>
<p>
It also gives to all regular users a graphical overview of what happened in their sites of interest.
</p>
<p>
The module *Activity Stats* was designed with ease of use and simplicity as a primary goal. Just install and add it to your dashboard to give it a try.
</p>
<p>
The information displayed is based on the built-in Alfresco activity feeds. So no additionnal content model or service (such as the Audit service) needs to be activated, and the general performance of the Alfresco server is thus not decreased.
</p>
<p>
You could however want to fine control the maximal size and duration of activity feeds. If so, please refer to section *Error! Reference source not found.* further in this document.
</p>

=4 Configuration=
<p>
The information displayed by Activity Stats module Is based on built-in activity feeds. Some Alfresco properties control the maximal size and duration of activity feeds.
</p>
Default property values are quite low for activity reporting on a medium period: 
{{{
# Activity feed max size and max age (eg. 44640 mins = 31 days)

activities.feed.max.size=100 
activities.feed.max.age.mins=44640
}}}

In order to change default values, simply override those 2 properties in '<'ALFRESCO>\tomcat\shared\classes\alfresco-global.properties
<p>
Note that later Alfresco releases (from 3.5.x branch) will enable the change of these parameters directly from the administrator console.
